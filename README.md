Treehouse Techdegree Project 10

Full Stack App with React and a Rest API

This is a full fledged React app that uses a custom API built in the previous unit.

The app displays a set of courses that are stored in a database. The courses are
displayed as cards in a flex grid that can clicked to view the details of each course.

In order to create a new course, or update/delete an existing course, th euser must log in.
The successfully logged in user is stored in a cookie that is accessed accross the app.

In order to run this application, extract the contents and navigate to the api and client folders 
respectively. In the api folder run 'npm install' to install the dependencies and then run 'npm
run seed' to seed the database. Running 'npm start' starts the api listening on port 5000
In the client folder run 'npm install' to install dependencies and then 'npm start' 
to start the app on port 3000.
